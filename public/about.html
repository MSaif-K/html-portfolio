<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  As a computer engineering undergraduate from <a href="https://antalya.edu.tr/en">Antalya Bilim University</a>, 
  I have gained knowledge in AI and completed many respective projects. One of the
  most important projects I completed was a stroke prediction system project. Using a large
  dataset of over 5,000 patient records with 11 features each, the program achieved a
  94% accuracy score and 93% average 10-fold cross-validation score. I possess
  strong skills in software development and data analysis, with a focus on delivering
  impactful results.
